# Azure storage account Container

Azure Blob Storage allows you to store large amounts of unstructured object data. You can use Blob Storage to gather or expose media, content, or application data to users. Because all blob data is stored within containers, you must create a storage container before you can begin to upload data. To learn more about Blob Storage, read the Introduction to Azure Blob storage.
